## Specificity

* IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, tags.
* HTML elements could have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.

```h1.special {

}```
The code above would select only the h1 elements that have a class of special. If a p element also had a class of special, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph.
